# PromoCode-Abuse-Detection-Model

This model helps in detecting >90%+ promo code abusers at both registration and transaction level which replaced the legacy manual method used by my client thus reducing 95% of the time in identifying promo abusers. This project involves various data pre-processing & modelling techniques using tools such as Python

The end results on my client database : for every 100 records, I achieved 94.55% Accuracy & 0.01% False Positives
